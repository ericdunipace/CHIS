## Introduction

## Changes to code

Minor - Used `svyglm` when survey adjusted standard errors needed

Larger - Changing how tables are created - Creating combined outcome variable based on K6 survey -

## Outcome
There are several potential outcomes

## K6

In the data, the survey questions `tg11`--`tg16` are from the [K6 survey instrument](https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs/k6_scales.php): 
<blockquote>
The K6 is best to use when you want to look at serious mental illness (about 5-8% of the population). The K6 was not designed to distinguish the top 1-2% from the rest of the population.
</blockquote>
